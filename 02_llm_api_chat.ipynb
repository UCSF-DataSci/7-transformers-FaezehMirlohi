      " Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body regulates blood sugar (glucose) levels. When you eat food, your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose, which your cells use for energy. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps your cells absorb glucose. In people with diabetes, the body either doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't use insulin efficiently, leading to high blood sugar levels. Here are some common symptoms of diabetes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Excessive Thirst and Hunger**: High blood sugar levels can cause your body to lose fluid, leading to increased thirst. Despite eating enough, you may still feel hungry because your body isn't able to convert food into energy efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Frequent Urination**: High blood sugar levels can cause your kidneys to work overtime to filter out the excess sugar, leading to more frequent urination.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Fatigue**: Without enough insulin to let glucose into your cells, your body can't convert the food you eat into energy, leading to fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Blurred Vision**: High blood sugar levels can cause the lens of your eye to swell, leading to blurred vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Slow-healing Sores or Frequent Infections**: High blood sugar levels can damage your blood vessels and nerves, slowing down blood flow and making it harder for your body to fight off infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Tingling, Numbness, or Pain in Hands or Feet**: High blood sugar levels can damage nerves, causing these symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Unintended Weight Loss**: Despite eating enough, you may lose weight because your body can't convert the food you eat into energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Darkened Skin**: In some people, diabetes can cause the skin around the neck or armpits to darken.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to talk to your doctor. They can perform a simple blood test to diagnose diabetes.\n"
